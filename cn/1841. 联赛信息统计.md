# [1841. 联赛信息统计](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/league-statistics/)

Table: Teams

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| team_id        | int     |
| team_name      | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
team_id 是该表主键.
每一行都包含了一个参加联赛的队伍信息.


Table: Matches

+-----------------+---------+
| Column Name     | Type    |
+-----------------+---------+
| home_team_id    | int     |
| away_team_id    | int     |
| home_team_goals | int     |
| away_team_goals | int     |
+-----------------+---------+
(home_team_id, away_team_id) 是该表主键.
每一行包含了一次比赛信息.
home_team_goals 代表主场队得球数.
away_team_goals 代表客场队得球数.
获得球数较多的队伍为胜者队伍.


写一段SQL，用来报告联赛信息. 统计数据应使用已进行的比赛来构建，其中获胜球队获得三分，而失败球队获得零分. 如果打平，两支球队都得一分.

result表的每行应包含以下信息:

team_name - Teams表中的队伍名字
matches_played - 主场与客场球队进行的比赛次数.
points - 球队获得的总分数.
goal_for - 球队在所有比赛中获取的总进球数
goal_against - 球队在所有比赛中，他的对手球队的所有进球数
goal_diff - goal_for - goal_against.
按分数降序返回结果表。 如果两队或多队得分相同，则按goal_diff 降序排列。 如果仍然存在平局，则以 team_name 按字典顺序排列它们。

查询的结果格式如下例所示:

Teams table:
+---------+-----------+
| team_id | team_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 1       | Ajax      |
| 4       | Dortmund  |
| 6       | Arsenal   |
+---------+-----------+

Matches table:
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |
| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |
| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |
| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+


Result table:
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |
| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |
| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+

Ajax (team_id=1) 有4场比赛: 2败2平. 总分数 = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund (team_id=4) 有2场比赛: 2胜. 总分数 = 3 + 3 = 6.
Arsenal (team_id=6) 有2场比赛: 2平. 总分数 = 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund 是积分榜上的第一支球队. Ajax和Arsenal 有同样的分数, 但Arsenal的goal_diff高于Ajax, 所以Arsenal在表中的顺序在Ajaxzhi'qian.

sql脚本：

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Teams (team_id int, team_name varchar(20));
Create table If Not Exists Matches (home_team_id int, away_team_id int, home_team_goals int, away_team_goals int);
Truncate table Teams;
insert into Teams (team_id, team_name) values ('1', 'Ajax');
insert into Teams (team_id, team_name) values ('4', 'Dortmund');
insert into Teams (team_id, team_name) values ('6', 'Arsenal');
Truncate table Matches;
insert into Matches (home_team_id, away_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) values ('1', '4', '0', '1');
insert into Matches (home_team_id, away_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) values ('1', '6', '3', '3');
insert into Matches (home_team_id, away_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) values ('4', '1', '5', '2');
insert into Matches (home_team_id, away_team_id, home_team_goals, away_team_goals) values ('6', '1', '0', '0');
```

# 解答

解法一：

```sql
-- 1. 作为主队时或客队时的信息统计 UNION ALL 避免去重
SELECT home_team_id team_id, home_team_goals goals_for, away_team_goals goals_against FROM Matches
UNION ALL
SELECT away_team_id team_id, away_team_goals goals_for, home_team_goals goals_against FROM Matches;

-- 2. 统计各队在作为主客队时的得分
SELECT
       team_id,
       goal_for,
       goal_against,
       (CASE
           WHEN  goal_for > goal_against THEN 3
           WHEN  goal_for = goal_against THEN 1
            ELSE  0
        END) points,
       goal_for - goal_against goal_diff

FROM (
      SELECT home_team_id team_id, home_team_goals goal_for, away_team_goals goal_against FROM Matches
      UNION ALL
      SELECT away_team_id team_id, away_team_goals goal_for, home_team_goals goal_against FROM Matches
     ) t;

-- 3. 统计各队的比赛情况
SELECT
    tm.team_name,
    COUNT(*) matches_played,
    SUM(t2.points) points,
    SUM(t2.goal_for) goal_for,
    SUM(t2.goal_against) goal_against,
    SUM(t2.goal_diff) goal_diff
FROM Teams tm JOIN (
    SELECT
        team_id,
        goal_for,
        goal_against,
        (CASE
             WHEN  goal_for > goal_against THEN 3
             WHEN  goal_for = goal_against THEN 1
             ELSE  0
            END) points,
        goal_for - goal_against goal_diff

    FROM (
             SELECT home_team_id team_id, home_team_goals goal_for, away_team_goals goal_against FROM Matches
             UNION ALL
             SELECT away_team_id team_id, away_team_goals goal_for, home_team_goals goal_against FROM Matches
         ) t1
    ) t2 ON (tm.team_id = t2.team_id) GROUP BY tm.team_name ORDER BY points DESC, goal_diff DESC, tm.team_name;
```

解法二：

```sql
SELECT distinct team_name,
                COUNT(*) AS matches_played,
                SUM(
                        CASE
                            WHEN (team_id=home_team_id AND home_team_goals>away_team_goals) OR
                                 (team_id=away_team_id AND home_team_goals<away_team_goals) THEN 3
                            WHEN (team_id=home_team_id AND home_team_goals<away_team_goals) OR
                                 (team_id=away_team_id AND home_team_goals>away_team_goals) THEN 0
                            ELSE 1 END) AS points,
                SUM(IF(team_id=home_team_id,home_team_goals,away_team_goals)) AS goal_for,
                SUM(IF(team_id=home_team_id,away_team_goals,home_team_goals)) AS goal_against,
                SUM(IF(team_id=home_team_id,home_team_goals,away_team_goals)) - SUM(IF(team_id=home_team_id,away_team_goals,home_team_goals)) AS goal_diff
FROM Teams JOIN Matches ON team_id=home_team_id OR team_id=away_team_id
GROUP BY team_name
ORDER BY points DESC, goal_diff DESC, team_name;
```
