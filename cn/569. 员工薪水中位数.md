## [569. 员工薪水中位数](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/median-employee-salary/)

Employee 表包含所有员工。Employee 表有三列：员工Id，公司名和薪水。

+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |
|8    | B          | 13     |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|10   | B          | 1345   |
|11   | B          | 1221   |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|13   | C          | 2345   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
|15   | C          | 2645   |
|16   | C          | 2652   |
|17   | C          | 65     |

请编写SQL查询来查找每个公司的薪水中位数。挑战点：你是否可以在不使用任何内置的SQL函数的情况下解决此问题。

+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
+-----+------------+--------+

sql脚本：

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Company varchar(255), Salary int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('1', 'A', '2341')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('2', 'A', '341')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('3', 'A', '15')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('4', 'A', '15314')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('5', 'A', '451')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('6', 'A', '513')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('7', 'B', '15')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('8', 'B', '13')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('9', 'B', '1154')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('10', 'B', '1345')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('11', 'B', '1221')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('12', 'B', '234')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('13', 'C', '2345')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('14', 'C', '2645')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('15', 'C', '2645')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('16', 'C', '2652')
insert into Employee (Id, Company, Salary) values ('17', 'C', '65')
```

### 解答

解法一：

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    Id, Company, Salary
FROM
    (SELECT 
        e.Id,
        e.Salary,
        e.Company,
        IF(@prev = e.Company, @Rank:=@Rank + 1, @Rank:=1) AS `Rank`,
        @prev:=e.Company
    FROM
        Employee e, (SELECT @Rank:=0, @prev:=0) AS temp
    ORDER BY e.Company , e.Salary , e.Id) Ranking
        INNER JOIN
    (SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS totalcount, Company AS name
    FROM
        Employee e2
    GROUP BY e2.Company) companycount ON companycount.name = Ranking.Company
WHERE
    `Rank` = FLOOR((totalcount + 1) / 2)
        OR `Rank` = FLOOR((totalcount + 2) / 2);
```

解法二：

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT b.id AS Id,b.company AS Company,b.salary AS Salary
FROM (
    SELECT id,company,salary,
    CASE @com WHEN company THEN @rk:=@rk+1 ELSE @rk:=1 END rk,
    @com:=company
    FROM Employee,(SELECT @rk:=0, @com:='') a
    ORDER BY company,salary) b
LEFT JOIN 
    (SELECT company,count(1)/2 cnt FROM Employee GROUP BY company) c
ON b.company=c.company
WHERE b.rk in (cnt+0.5,cnt+1,cnt);
```
